Function: 
I chose to calculate bmi with the formula weight/height**2. I then categorized the bmi to determine a health status. If the bmi is less than 18.5, it is categoried into underweight, between 18.5 and 24.9 is normal, and any bmi greater is overweight. This range is based on the CDC Adult BMI Calculator (with the exception of the obese range). The expected output is 25.9 and Overweight.
